During the election of 2016, there was an attempt to phish information from a political official. Phishing being a way for a user to trick someone unknowingly to expose their system to some form of malware. For this to work, someone had to be gullable enough to enter sensitive information into a field they wouldn't have normally navigated to. In both political parties, with terms being long and technology being relatively new, most members of either party could've been just as vulnerable to a simple phishing email such as the one recorded on March 19th 2016. An email stating someone had attempted to access their account and a password reset was required seemed all it took for John Podesta to start a chain of attacks leading to the leak of many campaign emails. With an election in progress, many members in the party would obviously be interested in ratings of their party member. This interest made creating phishing links too easy by simply labeling them along the lines of "hillaryclinton-favorable-ratings". To avoid this altogether, party members should have made direct contact with others in order to see if these were legitimate emails or not. From the sounds of the article, there are some who can pick up if the emails are phishing or legitimate (i.e. the staffer John had asked originally), maybe a training from those individuals instead of a reliance on them could've helped prevent such a fault in the first place.

In mid 2017 there was report of an attack on a taxing software infecting companies in 64 different countries, including Banks in Ukraine, Rosneft a Russion oil giant, and more. The belief behind the spread of this malware might've been from a hack of the updating process. If a hacker gets access to an update, they can set malicious script hidden with the trusted software. This is refered to as Cross-site scripting. Coming either from scripts on a webpage or emails from other infected users, this ransomware spread thanks to the trust built into their system. From the sounds of their report, this maleware was discovered early on but was kept secret from Microsoft and weaponized. Once leaked and made public, it was used for a cyber attack. A triple check of the updated code could've helped prevent any spread through the webpage, otherwise users need to be more careful with whom they're speaking with and clicking on.
